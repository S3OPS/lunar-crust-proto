## What Is This Game?

Middle-earth Adventure RPG is a 3D role-playing game inspired by The Lord of the Rings. You'll explore lands like The Shire, Rohan, and Mordor, fight enemies, complete quests, and meet characters like Gandalf, Legolas, and Gimli.

This game is built with **Godot Engine 4.3+**, a free and open-source game engine.

### Why Godot?

We chose Godot because:
- ✅ **100% Free** - No subscriptions, no royalties, ever
- ✅ **No Account Required** - Download and start immediately
- ✅ **Lightweight** - Small download (~50 MB vs Unity's 3+ GB)
- ✅ **Open Source** - Community-driven development

👉 **Learn more:** See [ALTERNATIVE_ENGINES.md](ALTERNATIVE_ENGINES.md) for the full migration story

## System Requirements

| Requirement | Details |

| **Operating System** | Windows 10/11, macOS 10.13+, or modern Linux |
| **Internet** | Required to download Godot (~80 MB) and game files |
| **Disk Space** | At least 500 MB free |
| **Graphics** | Any GPU with OpenGL 3.3 or Vulkan support |
| **Time** | About 5-10 minutes for setup |

## Installation

Follow these steps in order to set up the game.

   - **Right-click** → **"Extract All..."**
   - Choose where to save (Desktop or Documents recommended)
   - Click **Extract**
   - Open the extracted folder
   - **Double-click** `Godot_v4.3-stable_win64.exe` to run

**Pro tip:** Create a Desktop shortcut to the `.exe` file for easy access later.

#### On macOS:

1. **Open your web browser** and go to: `https://godotengine.org/download`

## Exporting the Game

Want to create a standalone executable that runs without Godot? Here's how to export the game.

### One-Time Setup: Install Export Templates

The first time you export, Godot needs to download export templates (~500 MB):

1. In Godot Editor: **Project → Export...**
2. If templates are missing, click **"Manage Export Templates"**
3. Click **"Download and Install"**
4. Wait for download (5-10 minutes)
5. Close the templates window

### Export Process

1. **Open Export Window**
   - **Project → Export...**

2. **Add Export Preset**
   - Click **"Add..."**
   - Choose your platform:
     - **Windows Desktop** - For Windows PC (.exe)
     - **Linux/X11** - For Linux
     - **macOS** - For Mac

3. **Configure Settings** (Optional)
   - Click your preset in the left sidebar
   - Key settings:
     - **Export With Debug**: Uncheck for final release
     - **Runnable**: Ensure checked

4. **Export**
   - Click **"Export Project"**
   - Choose save location
   - Name your file (e.g., `MiddleEarthAdventure.exe`)
   - Click **"Save"**
   - Wait 1-5 minutes

### What You Get

After export:

**On Windows:**
- `MiddleEarthAdventure.exe` - Game executable
- `MiddleEarthAdventure.pck` - Game data file

**On Linux:**
- `MiddleEarthAdventure.x86_64` - Game executable
- `MiddleEarthAdventure.pck` - Game data file

**On macOS:**

**Important:** Keep `.exe` and `.pck` files together! Both are needed.

You can share these files with others, and they can play without having Godot installed.

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

#### "Cannot download Godot" or slow download
- **Solution:** Try a different mirror from the download page
- Use the direct GitHub releases page: `https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases`

#### "Windows protected your PC" warning
- **Solution:** Click "More info" → "Run anyway"
- Godot is safe but not signed with a Windows certificate

#### macOS: "Godot.app is damaged and can't be opened"
- **Solution:** Run in Terminal:
  ```bash
  xattr -cr /path/to/Godot.app
  ```

#### Linux: "Permission denied"
- **Solution:** Make file executable:
  ```bash
  chmod +x Godot_v4.3-stable_linux.x86_64
  ```

---

### Project Issues

#### "Cannot open project" or "Project file is corrupted"
- Ensure you selected the `project.godot` file
- Make sure ZIP file was fully extracted
- Re-download if file may be corrupted

#### "Godot version mismatch" warning
- Godot 4.3+ is required
- Download the correct version from godotengine.org
- Compatibility within Godot 4.x is usually good

#### Missing scripts or errors on startup
1. Close Godot
2. Delete the `.godot` folder in project directory (import cache)
3. Reopen project in Godot
4. Wait for reimport (may take 1 minute)

---

### Runtime Issues

#### Scene appears empty or minimal in editor
- **This is normal!** The main scene looks minimal in the editor
- The full world is created at runtime when you press Play (F5)
- You should see terrain, NPCs, and enemies after starting the game

#### Game window shows no content after pressing Play
1. Check **Output** panel (View → Output) for errors
2. Ensure `main.tscn` is set as main scene:
   - **Project → Project Settings → Application → Run → Main Scene**
3. Try: **Project → Reload Current Project**

#### Game runs slowly
- Lower graphics settings: **Project → Project Settings → Rendering → Quality**
- Update your graphics drivers
- Close other applications
- Reduce window resolution

#### Keyboard/mouse not working in game
- Click inside the game window to give it focus
- Try Alt+Tab to switch to game window
- Check that no overlays are capturing input

#### Pink/magenta textures
1. Close Godot
2. Delete `.godot` folder in project directory
3. Reopen project and wait for reimport

---

### Export Issues

#### "No export template found"
- Install export templates: **Project → Export → Manage Export Templates**

#### Export button grayed out
- Add an export preset first (click "Add...")
- Ensure templates are installed

#### Exported game won't run
- Keep `.exe` and `.pck` files together
- On Linux, make file executable: `chmod +x filename`
- Check antivirus isn't blocking the file
- Try exporting with "Export With Debug" enabled to see errors

#### Exported game is very large
- Normal for 3D games with assets
- Uncheck "Export With Debug" in preset settings
- Enable "Optimize for File Size" in export settings
