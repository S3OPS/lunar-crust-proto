## What Is This Game?

Middle-earth Adventure RPG is a 3D role-playing game inspired by The Lord of the Rings. You'll explore lands like The Shire, Rohan, and Mordor, fight enemies, complete quests, and meet characters like Gandalf, Legolas, and Gimli.

This is a **Unity project**, which means it was made using a program called Unity. To play the game, you need to install Unity first.

### 🎮 Don't Want to Use Unity?

**Looking for alternatives?** This project is built with Unity, but if you'd prefer to build games with other free engines like Godot or Unreal, check out our comprehensive guide:

👉 **[Alternative Game Engines Guide](ALTERNATIVE_ENGINES.md)** — Learn about free alternatives to Unity

**Note:** This guide assumes you're using Unity. If you choose a different engine, you would need to rebuild the game from scratch in that engine.

---

## Step 2: Install Unity Editor

The Unity Editor is the actual program that runs the game. You need a specific version: **2022.3 LTS**.

### Open Unity Hub:

**Windows:**
- Click the **Start button** (Windows icon in the bottom-left corner)
- Type `Unity Hub`
- Click on **Unity Hub** when it appears

**macOS:**
- Click the **Launchpad** icon in your Dock (grid of squares icon)
- Click on **Unity Hub**

**Linux:**
- Run the AppImage you downloaded, or find Unity Hub in your applications menu

### Create a Unity Account (if you don't have one):

1. Unity Hub will ask you to sign in
2. Click **"Create account"** if you don't have one
3. Fill in your email address and create a password
4. Check your email for a verification link and click it
5. Go back to Unity Hub and sign in with your new account

### Get a Free License:

1. After signing in, Unity Hub may ask about a license

   - If you can't find exactly 2022.3.0f1, any 2022.3.x version should work
   - LTS means "Long Term Support" - it's a stable version
4. Click **Install** next to it
5. On the next screen, you can leave the default options selected
6. Click **Continue** or **Install**
7. **Wait** - this download is large (about 2-3 GB) and may take 15-30 minutes depending on your internet speed

---

## Step 3: Get the Game Files

You need to download or have the game project files on your computer.

### Option A: Download from GitHub (Recommended)

1. **Go to the project page**
   - Open your web browser
   - Go to the GitHub page where this project is hosted
   
2. **Download the files**
   - Look for a green button that says **"Code"**
   - Click it, then click **"Download ZIP"**
   - Wait for the download to complete

3. **Extract the files**
   
   **Windows:**
   - Go to your Downloads folder
   - Find the ZIP file (it will have the project name)
   - Right-click on it
   - Click **"Extract All..."**
   - Choose where to save it (your Documents folder is a good choice)
   - Click **Extract**
   
   **macOS:**
   - Go to your Downloads folder in Finder
   - Double-click the ZIP file
   - It will automatically extract to a folder

### Option B: If Someone Gave You a Folder

If someone gave you the project files on a USB drive or shared folder:
1. Copy the entire folder to a location on your computer (like Documents)
2. Make sure the folder contains folders named `Assets`, `ProjectSettings`, and `tools`

---

## Step 4: Open the Project in Unity

Now we'll connect everything together!

1. **Open Unity Hub** (if it's not already open)

2. **Add the project**
   - Click **"Projects"** in the left sidebar
   - Click the **"Add"** button (it might say "Add project from disk" or just show an "Add" arrow)
   - Navigate to where you saved/extracted the game files
   - Select the main project folder (the one containing `Assets`, `ProjectSettings`, etc.)
   - Click **"Add Project"** or **"Open"**

3. **Wait for Unity to process**
   - The first time you open a project, Unity needs to import all the files
   - This can take 5-15 minutes
   - You'll see a loading bar - just wait for it to finish

4. **The Unity Editor opens**
   - You'll see a complex interface with many panels
   - Don't worry! You only need to know a few things to play the game

---

## Step 5: Play the Game

Almost there! Just a couple more clicks:

1. **Open the Main scene** (if not already open)
   - In the Unity Editor, look at the bottom panel called **"Project"**
   - Navigate to `Assets/Scenes` (double-click folders to open them)
   - Double-click on **"Main"** (or **"Main.unity"**)
   - **Note:** The scene will appear empty in the Hierarchy - this is normal! The game world is created at runtime.

2. **Press Play!**
   - Look at the top-center of the Unity Editor
   - You'll see a **Play button** (▶️ triangle icon)
   - Click it!
   - The game will start in the center panel called "Game"
   - **After pressing Play**, you'll see the world appear with terrain, characters, NPCs, and enemies

3. **To stop playing**
   - Click the Play button again (the same button you used to start)

---

## Troubleshooting

### I only see an empty blue/gray scene (no game content)

**What it looks like:** The Game view shows just a skybox with no terrain, characters, or objects. 

**Understanding how this project works:**
The Main.unity scene is **intentionally empty**. This project uses a "runtime bootstrap" system - the entire game world is created automatically when you press Play. This is normal and by design!

**Before pressing Play:** The Hierarchy panel will be empty or show minimal objects - this is expected!

**After pressing Play:** You should see the full Middle-earth world with:
- Terrain (The Shire, Rohan, Mordor)
- Characters (Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli)
- Enemies (Orcs, Dark Servants)
- Player with camera

**If you see a different scene (like "SampleScene"):**

**What it means:** You're viewing the wrong scene. The actual game is in the "Main" scene.

**What to do:**
1. In the Unity Editor, look at the bottom panel called **"Project"**
2. Navigate to `Assets` → `Scenes` (double-click folders to open them)
3. Double-click on **"Main"** (or **"Main.unity"**)
4. Now press the **Play button** (▶️) at the top center

If you still see an empty scene after opening Main.unity, try:
- Make sure the file exists: look for `Main.unity` in `Assets/Scenes`
- Close Unity, delete the `Library` folder in the project, and reopen the project

If pressing Play doesn't show any content:
1. Check the Console window (Window → General → Console) for any red error messages
2. Make sure all scripts compiled successfully (no "Compiler Errors" at the bottom of Unity)
3. Try: Assets → Reimport All (this rebuilds all scripts)

### "Unity version mismatch" or similar warning

**What it means:** The project wants a slightly different Unity version.

**What to do:** 
- Usually you can just click "Continue" or "Open" and it will work fine
- If it doesn't work, go back to Unity Hub → Installs and install version 2022.3.0f1 specifically

### "Missing scripts" or pink/purple objects

**What it means:** Some files didn't load correctly.

**What to do:**
1. Close Unity
2. Delete the `Library` folder inside the project folder
3. Open the project again in Unity Hub
4. Wait for it to reimport (this may take a while)

### The game runs slowly

**What to do:**
- In Unity, go to **Edit → Project Settings → Quality**
- Choose a lower quality level
- Or press F7 in-game to access optimization utilities

### Unity Hub won't open

**Windows:** Try running it as administrator:
- Right-click on Unity Hub
- Select "Run as administrator"

**macOS:** Check your security settings:
- Go to System Preferences → Security & Privacy
- Click "Open Anyway" if Unity Hub is blocked

### "Not enough disk space"

**What to do:**
- Delete files you don't need from your computer
- Empty your Recycle Bin (Windows) or Trash (macOS)
- Try installing Unity on a different drive if you have one

### "All compiler errors must be fixed before you can enter play mode"

This is the most common issue for new users! It means Unity found problems in the code that must be resolved before you can play.

**Most likely cause:** You're using a different Unity version than the project requires.

**Step-by-step fix:**

1. **Check which Unity version you have installed**
   - Open Unity Hub
   - Click **Installs** in the left sidebar
   - Note the version number (e.g., 2022.3.5f1)

2. **Install the correct version (2022.3.0f1)**
   - This project was made with Unity **2022.3.0f1**
   - In Unity Hub → Installs → Click **Install Editor**
   - Look for **2022.3.0f1** in the list and install it
   - If you can't find exactly 2022.3.0f1, any **2022.3.x** version should work

3. **Re-open the project with the correct version**
   - In Unity Hub → Projects
   - Click the dropdown arrow next to the project's Unity version
   - Select **2022.3.0f1** (or your 2022.3.x version)
   - Wait for Unity to reimport the project

**If you still get errors after using the correct Unity version:**

1. **Clear the Library folder** (this forces Unity to rebuild everything)
   - Close Unity completely
   - Open the project folder in File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (macOS)
   - Delete the folder named `Library`
   - Open the project again in Unity Hub
   - Wait for Unity to reimport all files (this may take 5-15 minutes)

2. **Check for missing packages**
   - In Unity, go to **Window → Package Manager**
   - Look for any packages with warning icons
   - Click **Update** or **Install** for any missing packages

3. **Refresh the project**
   - In Unity, go to **Assets → Reimport All**
   - Wait for the reimport to complete

**Still having problems?**
- Make sure you downloaded the complete project (all folders: Assets, ProjectSettings, etc.)
- Try downloading the project again from GitHub using "Download ZIP"
- If on Windows, avoid special characters in the project path (like #, %, &, etc.)

### I see errors in red text in Unity

**What to do:**
- Click on the red text at the bottom of Unity to see the error details
- Often you can ignore warnings (yellow text) and still play the game
- If it says "Script error" or "NullReferenceException", try closing and reopening the project

### "The layout could not be fully loaded"

**What it looks like:**
```
The layout "C:/Users/.../Unity/Editor-5.x/Preferences/Layouts/current/default-2022.dwlt" 
could not be fully loaded, this can happen when the layout contains EditorWindows 
not available in this project.
```

**What it means:** Your Unity Editor had a saved window layout from a previous project that uses different windows than this project. This is just a warning - it won't prevent you from playing the game.

**What to do:**
- This warning is **harmless** and you can usually **ignore it**
- Unity will automatically use a default layout instead
- To get rid of the warning permanently:
  1. In Unity, go to **Window → Layouts → Default**
  2. This resets your editor layout to the standard arrangement
  3. The warning won't appear next time you open the project

### "error CS0006: Metadata file could not be found" (com.unity.collab-proxy)

**What it looks like:**
```
error CS0006: Metadata file 'Library/PackageCache/com.unity.collab-proxy@.../Lib/Editor/PlasticSCM/log4netPlastic.dll' could not be found
error CS0006: Metadata file 'Library/PackageCache/com.unity.collab-proxy@.../Unity.Plastic.Antlr3.Runtime.dll' could not be found
error CS0006: Metadata file 'Library/PackageCache/com.unity.collab-proxy@.../Unity.Plastic.Newtonsoft.Json.dll' could not be found
```

**What it means:** The Unity Collaborate/Plastic SCM package files are corrupted or incomplete. This is a known Unity issue that can happen when the package cache becomes corrupted.

**Step-by-step fix:**

1. **Close Unity completely**
   - Make sure the Unity Editor is fully closed

2. **Delete the Library folder**
   - Open the project folder in File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (macOS)
   - Find and delete the folder named `Library`
   - This is safe to delete - Unity will rebuild it

3. **Delete the package cache** (if the above doesn't work)
   - Close Unity completely
   - Navigate to your global Unity package cache (note: these are hidden folders):
     - **Windows:** 
       1. Press **Windows key + R** to open the Run dialog
       2. Type `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Unity\cache\packages` and press Enter
       3. This opens the packages folder directly
     - **macOS:** 
       1. Open **Finder**
       2. Click **Go** in the menu bar, then hold **Option** key and click **Library**
       3. Navigate to `Unity/cache/packages`
       4. Full path: `/Users/YourUsername/Library/Unity/cache/packages` (replace "YourUsername" with your actual username)
   - Delete the `com.unity.collab-proxy` folder (or delete the entire `packages` folder to be thorough)
   - Open your project again in Unity Hub

4. **If errors persist, manually refresh packages**
   - In Unity, go to **Window → Package Manager**
   - Find **Version Control** (formerly Collaborate) in the list
   - Click the **menu button with three vertical dots** next to the package and select **Remove**
   - After removal, restart Unity
   - If you need Version Control, you can reinstall it from Package Manager

5. **Alternative: Update the package**
   - Open your project's `Packages/manifest.json` file
   - Find the line with `"com.unity.collab-proxy"`
   - Update the version number to a newer version (check Unity Package Manager for latest)
   - Save the file and let Unity reimport

**Note:** The `com.unity.collab-proxy` package is for Unity's cloud collaboration features. If you're not using cloud collaboration, removing this package won't affect your ability to play the game.

### "TLS Allocator ALLOC_TEMP_TLS, underlying allocator ALLOC_TEMP_MAIN has unfreed allocations"

**What it looks like:**
```
TLS Allocator ALLOC_TEMP_TLS, underlying allocator ALLOC_TEMP_MAIN has unfreed allocations, size 37
```

**What it means:** This is a Unity memory allocation warning that occurs when temporary memory isn't being properly cleaned up. This can happen during scene loading, script compilation, or when certain Unity systems don't release their temporary buffers correctly.

**Why the main scene might not populate:** If this error appears along with an empty scene after pressing Play, it usually indicates that the runtime bootstrap system failed to initialize properly due to a memory or script issue.

**Step-by-step fix:**

1. **Restart Unity completely**
   - Close Unity Editor
   - Wait a few seconds
   - Reopen the project from Unity Hub
   - This clears temporary memory allocations

2. **Clear the Library folder** (most effective)
   - Close Unity completely
   - Open the project folder in File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (macOS)
   - Delete the entire `Library` folder
   - Reopen the project in Unity Hub
   - Wait for Unity to reimport all assets (5-15 minutes)

3. **Debug with diagnostic command** (advanced)
   - To identify the exact source of the memory leak, run Unity with the diagnostic flag:
     - **Windows:** Open Command Prompt and run:
       ```
       "C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\2022.3.0f1\Editor\Unity.exe" -projectPath "YOUR_PROJECT_PATH" -diag-temp-memory-leak-validation
       ```
     - **macOS:** Open Terminal and run:
       ```
       /Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/2022.3.0f1/Unity.app/Contents/MacOS/Unity -projectPath "YOUR_PROJECT_PATH" -diag-temp-memory-leak-validation
       ```
   - Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_PATH` with the full path to your project folder
   - Replace `2022.3.0f1` with your actual Unity version
   - This outputs call stacks showing exactly where the leaked allocations originate

4. **Check for script compilation errors**
   - In Unity, open the Console window: **Window → General → Console**
   - Look for any red error messages
   - All script errors must be fixed before the runtime bootstrap can work
   - Try: **Assets → Reimport All** to recompile all scripts

5. **Ensure correct Unity version**
   - This project requires **Unity 2022.3.x LTS**
   - Using a significantly different Unity version can cause memory allocation issues
   - In Unity Hub, verify you're using a 2022.3.x version

6. **Check for corrupted project settings**
   - Close Unity
   - In your project folder, delete the `Library` folder AND the `Temp` folder
   - Reopen the project and let Unity rebuild everything

**If the main scene still doesn't populate after these steps:**

1. **Verify the Main scene is loaded**
   - Check the Hierarchy panel (left side) - it should show objects like "World Builder", "Player", etc. after pressing Play
   - If empty, make sure you opened `Assets/Scenes/Main.unity` (not SampleScene or another scene)

2. **Check that bootstrap scripts exist**
   - In the Project panel, navigate to `Assets/Scripts/RPG`
   - Verify that core files like `WorldBuilder.cs`, `NPCManager.cs`, and `QuestManager.cs` exist
   - If files are missing, re-download the project from GitHub

3. **Look for specific errors in Console**
   - Click on any red error messages to see details
   - Common issues:
     - `NullReferenceException` - A script couldn't find a required object
     - `MissingReferenceException` - A reference to a deleted object
     - `TypeLoadException` - Script compilation issue

4. **Try a fresh download**
   - If nothing else works, download the project again from GitHub
   - Extract to a new folder with a simple path (avoid special characters)
   - Open the fresh project in Unity

**Note:** The "unfreed allocations, size 37" warning by itself (without the scene failing to load) is often harmless and can be ignored. It only becomes a problem when combined with other issues like the scene not populating.

## Building the Game (Creating a Standalone Executable)

So far, we've been playing the game *inside* the Unity Editor. But what if you want to create a standalone game that you (or your friends) can play **without** having Unity installed? That's called "building" the game!

### What Does "File → Build Settings → Add Open Scenes → Build & Run" Mean?

You might see this instruction: **File → Build Settings → Add Open Scenes → Build & Run**

Let's break this down step-by-step in simple terms:

---

#### Step 1: "File →" (Open the File Menu)

**What it means:** Click on the word "File" at the very top-left of the Unity window.

**Think of it like:** Opening the File menu in Microsoft Word or any other program. It's where you find options to save, open, and export your work.

**How to do it:**
1. Look at the top of the Unity Editor window
2. You'll see a menu bar with words like: File, Edit, Assets, GameObject, Component...
3. Click on **"File"**
4. A dropdown menu will appear with many options

---

#### Step 2: "→ Build Settings" (Open Build Settings Window)

**What it means:** In the File menu, click on "Build Settings..." to open a special window for creating your game.

**Think of it like:** When you write a document in Word, "Build Settings" is like choosing "Export to PDF" or "Save As" - it's where you decide how to package your work.

**How to do it:**
1. After clicking "File", look for **"Build Settings..."** in the dropdown menu
2. Click on it
3. A new window will pop up called "Build Settings"

**What you'll see:** The Build Settings window shows:
- **Scenes In Build** - A list at the top (might be empty)
- **Platform** - Options like Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, etc.
- **Build** and **Build And Run** buttons at the bottom

---

#### Step 3: "→ Add Open Scenes" (Add Your Game Scene to the Build)

**What it means:** Tell Unity which scene(s) to include when building the game.

**Why is this important?** Unity projects can have many different scenes (like different levels or menus in a game). You need to tell Unity which scenes should be part of your final game. If you don't add any scenes, your built game will have nothing to show!

**Think of it like:** If you're creating a photo album, you need to tell the printer which photos to include. "Add Open Scenes" says "include the photo (scene) I'm currently looking at."

**How to do it:**
1. Make sure you have the **Main** scene open (you should have done this earlier - double-click Main.unity in Assets/Scenes)
2. In the Build Settings window, look at the top section called **"Scenes In Build"**
3. If it's empty or doesn't show your scene, click the **"Add Open Scenes"** button
4. You should now see `Scenes/Main` (with a checkmark) in the list

**Note:** The checkbox next to each scene means "include this scene in the build." Make sure your Main scene is checked!

---

#### Step 4: "→ Build & Run" (Create and Launch the Game!)

**What it means:** This final step creates the actual game files and immediately runs the game so you can test it.

**Think of it like:** Pressing "Print" on a document - it takes your work and creates the final product. "Build & Run" is like pressing Print AND automatically opening the printed document.

**The difference between "Build" and "Build And Run":**
- **Build** - Creates the game files but doesn't run them
- **Build And Run** - Creates the game files AND immediately starts the game

**How to do it:**
1. First, make sure the correct **Platform** is selected on the left side
   - For Windows: Select "Windows, Mac, Linux" and make sure "Target Platform" says "Windows"
   - For Mac: Select "Windows, Mac, Linux" and make sure "Target Platform" says "macOS"
2. Click the **"Build And Run"** button at the bottom-right
3. A window will pop up asking WHERE to save your game
   - Choose a folder (like your Desktop or a new folder called "My Game Build")
   - Give your game a name (like "MiddleEarthAdventure")
   - Click **Save**
4. **Wait** - Unity is now creating all the game files. This can take 5-20 minutes depending on your computer (first builds take longer)
5. When it's done, the game will automatically start!

---

### Summary: The Whole Process in Plain English

Here's the complete flow:

```
📁 File             → Opens the main menu
   ↓
⚙️ Build Settings   → Opens the "export" options window
   ↓
➕ Add Open Scenes  → Tells Unity "include my current scene in the game"
   ↓
▶️ Build & Run      → Creates the actual game files and plays it!
```

**In even simpler terms:** You're telling Unity to "package up my game scene and create an actual game file I can share with others, then run it so I can test it."

---

### What Do You Get After Building?

After the build completes, you'll have a folder containing:

### Common Build Issues

**"No scenes have been added to the build"**
- You forgot to click "Add Open Scenes"
- Make sure Main.unity is open before clicking Add Open Scenes

**Build takes forever or seems stuck**
- Large games take time to build (5-20 minutes is normal, first builds take longer)
- Make sure you have enough disk space (at least 2-3 GB free)

**Game runs but shows nothing / black screen**
- Make sure the Main scene was added to Build Settings with a checkmark
- Make sure the Main scene is listed as index 0 (the first scene in the list)

**"Development Build" watermark on screen**
- In Build Settings, uncheck "Development Build" if you don't want this

## What's Next?

Now that you're playing, here are some tips for beginners:

1. **Start in The Shire** (the green area to the southwest) - it's the easiest area
2. **Talk to NPCs** - walk into characters like Gandalf to interact
3. **Open treasure chests** - walk into them to get items and gold
4. **Complete quests** - press J to see your active quests
5. **Level up** - defeat enemies to gain experience and become stronger
