# Godot Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

Started from scratch to create a Godot 4.x implementation of Middle-earth Adventure RPG, using the Unity version as reference. **Phases 1-2 Complete (50% of roadmap)**.

**Current Version:** Godot Alpha v0.2

## 📦 What Was Built

### Foundation (Phase 1) ✅
```
Player Character
├── Movement (WASD + mouse camera)
├── Sprint (Shift, drains stamina)
├── Jump (Space)
├── Melee Attack (Left-click, 0.5s cooldown)
└── Special AOE Attack (Right-click, 5s cooldown, 30 stamina)

Character Progression
├── Health System (100 base, +20 per level)
├── Stamina System (100 base, +10 per level, auto-regen)
├── XP & Leveling (scales by 1.5x per level)
└── Stats (Strength, Wisdom, Agility +2 per level)

Core Systems
├── GameManager (game state, statistics)
├── EventBus (40+ signals for events)
├── SaveManager (JSON, 5 slots)
└── Constants (30+ balance values)
```

### Core Systems (Phase 2) ✅
```
Enemy AI
├── State Machine (5 states)
│   ├── Patrol (wander around spawn)
│   ├── Chase (follow when detected)
│   ├── Attack (melee in range)
│   ├── Flee (when HP < 20%)
│   └── Dead (XP reward, fade out)
├── NavigationAgent3D (pathfinding)
└── Combat (damage player, flash on hit)

HUD System
├── Health Bar (real-time)
├── Stamina Bar (real-time)
├── XP Progress Bar (to next level)
└── Level Display

World
├── Terrain (100x100 plane)
├── NavigationRegion3D (for AI)
├── Lighting (directional sun)
└── 3 Enemy Spawns
```

## 🎮 Gameplay Loop (Functional)

```
Player spawns
    ↓
Move around terrain (WASD + mouse)
    ↓
Enemies patrol → detect player → chase → attack
    ↓
Player attacks enemies (left-click / right-click)
    ↓
Enemies take damage → flash red → die when HP = 0
    ↓
Player gains XP → levels up when threshold reached
    ↓
Stats increase automatically → player becomes stronger
    ↓
HUD updates in real-time (health, stamina, XP, level)
```

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Architecture
- **Signal-Based**: EventBus with 40+ signals for decoupled communication
- **Resource Pattern**: CharacterStats as reusable, serializable data
- **State Machine**: Clean enemy AI with 5 distinct states
- **Autoload Singletons**: GameManager, EventBus, SaveManager globally accessible
- **Constants-Driven**: All balance values in one file for easy tuning

### Godot Advantages Used
- **NavigationAgent3D**: Better than Unity's NavMesh, built-in and efficient
- **Signals**: Cleaner than Unity's events, native to engine
- **CharacterBody3D**: Simpler movement controller than Unity's CharacterController
- **Tweens**: Easy animations without timeline
- **Resources**: Easier serialization than Unity's ScriptableObjects

### Code Quality
- ✅ Zero hardcoded magic numbers
- ✅ Type hints on all functions
- ✅ Doc comments on all classes
- ✅ Organized folder structure
- ✅ No circular dependencies
- ✅ No code duplication

## 📝 Notes for Developers

### Running the Project
1. Install Godot 4.3 or later
2. Open `project.godot`
3. Press F5 to run
4. No dependencies needed!

### Modifying Game Balance
All values are in `scripts/utilities/constants.gd`:
- Player speed, jump height, stamina regen
- Enemy health, damage, detection range
- Combat damage, crit chance, cooldowns
- XP scaling, stat increases per level

### Adding New Enemies
1. Duplicate `scenes/enemies/orc.tscn`
2. Modify stats in inspector
3. Change mesh/material
4. Add to main scene

### Debugging
- Set `EventBus.debug_mode = true` for signal logging
- Use `print()` statements (Godot's Output panel)
- Check Navigation debugging in editor
