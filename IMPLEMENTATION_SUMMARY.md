## 🎮 Gameplay Loop (Functional)

```
Player spawns
    ↓
Move around terrain (WASD + mouse)
    ↓
Enemies patrol → detect player → chase → attack
    ↓
Player attacks enemies (left-click / right-click)
    ↓
Enemies take damage → flash red → die when HP = 0
    ↓
Player gains XP → levels up when threshold reached
    ↓
Stats increase automatically → player becomes stronger
    ↓
HUD updates in real-time (health, stamina, XP, level)
```

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Architecture
- **Signal-Based**: EventBus with 41 signals for decoupled communication
- **Resource Pattern**: CharacterStats as reusable, serializable data
- **State Machine**: Clean enemy AI with 5 distinct states
- **Autoload Singletons**: GameManager, EventBus, SaveManager, QuestManager, InventoryManager, DialogueManager globally accessible
- **Constants-Driven**: All balance values in one file for easy tuning

### Godot Advantages Used
- **NavigationAgent3D**: Better than Unity's NavMesh, built-in and efficient
- **Signals**: Cleaner than Unity's events, native to engine
- **CharacterBody3D**: Simpler movement controller than Unity's CharacterController
- **Tweens**: Easy animations without timeline
- **Resources**: Easier serialization than Unity's ScriptableObjects

### Code Quality
- ✅ Zero hardcoded magic numbers
- ✅ Type hints on all functions
- ✅ Doc comments on all classes
- ✅ Organized folder structure
- ✅ No circular dependencies
- ✅ No code duplication

## 📝 Notes for Developers

### Running the Project
1. Install Godot 4.3 or later
2. Open `project.godot`
3. Press F5 to run
4. No dependencies needed!

### Modifying Game Balance
All values are in `scripts/utilities/constants.gd`:
- Player speed, jump height, stamina regen
- Enemy health, damage, detection range
- Combat damage, crit chance, cooldowns
- XP scaling, stat increases per level

### Adding New Enemies
1. Duplicate `scenes/enemies/orc.tscn`
2. Modify stats in inspector
3. Change mesh/material
4. Add to main scene

### Debugging
- Set `EventBus.debug_mode = true` for signal logging
- Use `print()` statements (Godot's Output panel)
- Check Navigation debugging in editor
